# SonarQube Perl Plugin (alpha)

This is a spike to figure out how easy features like code coverage
and Perl::Critic and test reporting can be integrated into SonarQube.
Given enough interest this could be upgraded into a proper open source project.

## Current State

Current plugin analyzes perl projects without having to parse the perl 
code itself, attaching the raw source as line-based text. In a 
later step there could be some proper parsing and analyzing, e.g. based 
on the ANTLR grammar from the Perl Eclipse integration (EPIC) or
the IntelliJ-Perl grammar.

What we have so far...

* LOC reporting
* Syntax highlighting of imported code
* Perl::Critic issues can be attached

## Running it

The easiest way to see SonarQube with the Perl Plugin in action is to 
execute our sample perl project with `sonar-scanner` against
a local SonarQube installation using `docker-compose`.

First, start up the SonarQube docker container, that has the
latest sonar-perl installed.

```sh
docker-compose up -d sonarperl
```

Wait for SonarQube to start-up and then open the web interface in your browser
(http://localhost:9000/ - or the IP you bound your docker to).
Then, run the `sonar-scanner` on the sample project.

```sh
docker-compose run sample
```

You should see a "perl sample project" on your SonarQube dashboard.


## Installing into your SonarQube

Plugin releases can be downloaded from our [github releases page](https://github.com/otrosien/sonar-perl/releases). 
If you want to build a snapshot version from source, you can create it via `./gradlew sonar-perl-plugin:jar` and
copy the resulting file (usually suffixed -SNAPSHOT, unless you checked out a release tag) 
e.g. `sonar-perl-plugin/build/sonar-perl-plugin-0.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` into the plugins
directory of your SonarQube installation (should be something like `/opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/`)


### Compatibility

We build and test against the current LTS release (5.6), SonarQube 6.x should work as well. Please report bugs
or incompatibilities in our [bugtracker](https://github.com/otrosien/sonar-perl/issues).

## Building all from source

Running a full build includes creation of the plugin-jar and a docker image.
This is achieved by running `./gradlew build`. Note that you 
need to have a local docker daemon running for this.

## Next steps

* The clover report does not contain line-based coverage information. This is crucial for sonarqube to calculate coverage details. Thus, either the clover report needs to be enhanced or we need to find a different solution altogether.

* Test reporting

## Links

* [Devel::Cover::Report::Clover](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover-Report-Clover/lib/Devel/Cover/Report/Clover.pm) 
  and [Sonar Clover Plugin](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONARQUBE45/Clover+Plugin) for coverage reporting
* Perl [TAP](https://testanything.org/) and [SonarQube TAP parser](https://github.com/dbac2002/sonar-tap-parser) for test reporting
* [Perl::Critic](http://perlcritic.org/) for issue reporting
